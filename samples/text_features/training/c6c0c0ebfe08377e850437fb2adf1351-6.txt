Chelsea's highest appearance-maker is ex-captain Ron Harris, who played in 795 first-class games for the club between 1961 and 1980.For the appearance and goalscoring records of all Chelsea players, see  This record is unlikely to be broken in the near future; Chelsea's current highest appearance-maker is Frank Lampard with 287 for the club (427 total for his career). The record for a Chelsea goalkeeper is held by Harris's contemporary, Peter Bonetti, who made 729 appearances (1959Ã¢ÂÂ79). With 116 caps (74 while at the club), Marcel Desailly of France is Chelsea's most capped international player.  Bobby Tambling is Chelsea's all-time top goalscorer, with 202 goals in 370 games (1959Ã¢ÂÂ70). Eight other players have also scored over 100 goals for Chelsea: George Hilsdon (1906Ã¢ÂÂ12), George Mills (1929Ã¢ÂÂ39), Roy Bentley (1948Ã¢ÂÂ56), Jimmy Greaves (1957Ã¢ÂÂ61), Peter Osgood (1964Ã¢ÂÂ74   1978Ã¢ÂÂ79), Kerry Dixon (1983Ã¢ÂÂ92), Frank Lampard (2001Ã¢ÂÂ) and Didier Drogba (2004Ã¢ÂÂ). With 193 goals, Dixon is the only player in the club's recent history to have come close to matching Tambling's record. Greaves holds the record for the most goals scored in one season (43 in 1960Ã¢ÂÂ61). Lampard is the top scorer currently at the club.  Officially, Chelsea's highest home attendance is 82,905 for a First Division match against Arsenal on 12 October 1935. However, an estimated crowd of over 100,000 attended a friendly match against Soviet team Dynamo Moscow on 13 November 1945.  The modernisation of Stamford Bridge during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands mean that neither record will be broken for the foreseeable future. The current legal capacity of Stamford Bridge is 42,055.  Chelsea hold numerous records in English and European football. They hold the record for the highest ever points total for a league season (95), the fewest goals conceded during a league season (15), the highest number of Premier League victories in a season (29), the highest number of clean sheets overall in a Premier League season (25) (all set during the 2004Ã¢ÂÂ05 season), and the most consecutive clean sheets from the start of a league season (6).  The club's 21Ã¢ÂÂ0 aggregate victory over Jeunesse Hautcharage in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1971 remains a record in European competition. Chelsea hold the record for the longest streak of unbeaten matches at home in the English top-flight, which lasted 86 matches from 20 March 2004 to 26 October 2008. They secured the record on 12 August 2007, beating the previous record of 63 matches unbeaten set by Liverpool between 1978 and 1980. Chelsea's streak of eleven consecutive away league wins, set between 5 April 2008 and 6 December 2008, is also a record for the English top flight.  Chelsea have recorded several "firsts" in English football. Along with Arsenal, they were the first club to play with shirt numbers on 25 August 1928 in their match against Swansea Town. Chelsea were the first English side to travel by aeroplane to a domestic away match, when they visited Newcastle United on 19 April 1957, and the first First Division side to play a match on a Sunday, when they faced Stoke City on 27 January 1974. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first British side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up (no British or Irish players) in a Premier League match against Southampton. On 19 May 2007, they became the first team to win the FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium, having also been the last to win it at the old Wembley. After the conclusion of the 2007/08 season, Chelsea became the highest ranked club under UEFA's five-year coefficient system used in the seeding of European club competitions in the following season, the first English club to do so in the 21st century.
